5. **Valid Parentheses** (Easy) - String, Stack

## Supported Languages

- JavaScript
- Python
- Java
- C++

## Key Components

### Problem Table (`/`)
- Displays all available problems
- Shows difficulty levels with color coding
- Includes tags and status indicators
- Click any problem to open the coding interface

### Problem Interface (`/problem/[id]`)
- **Left Panel**: Problem description, examples, constraints, tags
- **Right Panel**: Code editor with language selection
- **Tabs**: Switch between Description and Submissions
- **Actions**: Run code and Submit solution
- **Console**: Output area for code execution

## Customization

### Adding New Problems
Edit `src/data/questions.ts` to add new problems:

```typescript
{
  id: 6,
  title: "Your Problem Title",
  difficulty: "Easy" | "Medium" | "Hard",
  description: "Problem description...",
  examples: [{ input: "...", output: "...", explanation: "..." }],
  constraints: ["constraint1", "constraint2"],
  tags: ["Array", "String"],
  starterCode: {
    javascript: "function solution() {\n    // Your code here\n}",
    python: "def solution():\n    # Your code here\n    pass",
    // ... other languages
  }
}
```

### Styling
- Global styles in `src/app/globals.css`
- Tailwind CSS classes for component styling
- Custom scrollbar and Monaco editor theming included

## Integration Notes

### Judge0 Integration
The application is structured to easily integrate with Judge0:

1. Replace the mock `handleRun` and `handleSubmit` functions
2. Add API endpoints for code execution
3. Update the console output with real execution results
4. Implement real-time execution status

### Backend Integration
- Problem data can be moved to a database
- User authentication can be added
- Submission history can be tracked
- Progress and statistics can be implemented

## Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev          # Start development server
pnpm build        # Build for production
pnpm start        # Start production server
pnpm lint         # Run ESLint
```
